# Project Background
The dataset consist of list of BMW cars that was collected and recorded from various models, years, and other specification. Other stats that was included are Miles per Galoon (MPG) and the engine size of each car to calculate the efficiency of all cars.

The datasets then used to make a tableau dashboard that provide comprehensive detail upon several key areas. This project thoroughly analyzes and synthesizes this data in order to uncover critical insights that hopefully would help buyer of BMW car make decisions.

Insights and recommendations are provided on the following key areas:

* Model Analysis: A quick analysis on price and efficiency of BMW cars by their models.
* Transmission Type Analysis: A quick analysis on price and efficiency of BMW cars by their transmission type as well as the amount of cars recorded.
* Fuel Type Analysis: A quick overview on price and efficiency of BMW cars by their fuel type.

An interactive Tableau dashboard can be downloaded here.

The dataset used is sourced from Kaggle and is used solely for practice and learning purposes.

# Executive Summary
### Overview of Findings  
The dataset include many different type of BMW car which can be divided by their models, transmission, and fuel type. The following sections will provide a more detailed analysis on several keypoint to highlight their price and efficiency thoroughly.

Below is the quantity of each car included by their transmission and fuel type from the tableau dashboard with more examples included throughout the report. The entire interactive storyboard can be downloaded here.

### Model Analysis:
* BMW vehicles experience steep price depreciation within the first 5–10 years.
* After ~15 years, prices stabilize at much lower levels, regardless of original MSRP.
* BMW Z3 and 1 Series have the lowest average prices, making them the most accessible entry points into the BMW brand.
* BMW i3 dominates MPG performance, significantly outperforming other models.

### Transmission Type Analysis:
* Automatic BMWs account for the largest share of vehicles, especially after 2010.
* Production and availability of automatics increased sharply between 2014–2019, reflecting market preference and technological advancement.
* Manual and semi-automatic transmissions show slightly lower MPG, indicating a performance-oriented tuning.
* Semi-automatic vehicles grow steadily, signaling BMW’s move toward performance automation.

### Fuel Type Analysis:
* Alternative fuel types (electric, hybrid, other) remain smaller but growing segments compared than diesel amd petrol.
* Electric BMWs deliver significantly higher MPG-equivalent, far exceeding other fuel types.
* Diesel models offer moderate pricing (~$29.4K) with strong fuel efficiency, making them attractive for long-distance drivers.
* However, diesel vehicles carry higher average taxes compared to electric and hybrid options.

### Recommendations:
Based on the uncovered insights, the following recommendations have been provided:  
* Buy a 5–10 year old BMW — this captures the steep depreciation while retaining modern features and drivability.
* A newer, high-mileage BMW may be worse value than an older, well-maintained low-mileage one.
* Opt for a Manual BMW if price is a priority and driving engagement matters more than convenience.
* Choose an Electric BMW for maximum fuel efficiency, minimal tax, and lower long-term operating expenses.
* Hybrid BMWs provide a blend of performance and sustainability but at a higher upfront cost.
